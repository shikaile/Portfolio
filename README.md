<p> This Project will help you seek out the release date of an upcoming shoe Release that you are intrested in and give you the historical weather of that day. Once the city is selected the user can then search the shoe release date, to check the historical weather. If the weather is sunny a message will be sent to the user to let them know the shoe could be worn on the release date.
